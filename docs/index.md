# ðŸ§ª Hands-On Lab: FortiAppSec Cloud

## Introduction

Welcome to this hands-on lab focused on **FortiAppSec Cloud**, Fortinetâ€™s SaaS-based Web Application Firewall (WAF) and API protection platform.

In this lab, you will test FortiAppSec Cloud using the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** â€” a deliberately insecure application available at

## Lab 1 â€“ Exploring the FortiAppSec Cloud Portal

In this first lab, you will explore the **FortiAppSec Cloud** interface, understand how **licensing** works, and become familiar with key concepts related to **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** configuration.

## Lab 2 â€“ Onboarding Your First Application

In this lab, you will onboard the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** into **FortiAppSec Cloud**. Once onboarded, FortiAppSec Cloud will inspect all inbound traffic, providing protection against common threats including the **OWASP Top 10** and **zero-day exploits**. All traffic to DVWA will be encrypted and routed through FortiAppSec Cloud, where it will be filtered before reaching the application.

## Lab 3 â€“ Exploring Standard Protections

In this lab, you will access the DVWA application through FortiAppSec Cloud, where the **StandardProtection-Clone** profile is applied. This profile enables a set of core WAF modules, including protections against known attacks, malicious bots, IP-based threats, and abnormal traffic patterns. You will observe how these protections are automatically enforced when interacting with the application.
